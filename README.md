This will run nodemon with `server.js` which will run next.js development environment on port
`3000`.

## Developing

### Built With

[Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), [React](https://reactjs.org/),
[Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/),
[Bootstrap 4 (beta)](https://getbootstrap.com), [React-Strap](https://reactstrap.github.io),
[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

### Prerequisites

```

It will run next.js `next build && next export` commands which will generate static files in folder
`out`. It will ONLY export routes which are defined in `next.config.js` file.

### Deploying / Publishing

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will automatically runs `npm run build-static
` command whenever anything is pushed to `master` branch since it is
connected to this github repository. After that the changes should be reachable on https://masifunde.netlify.com.

## Configuration

* Contentful credentials are hard coded.
* Robots are defined in `robots.txt` and all included always in export. IMPORTANT - at the moment it
  blocks all crawlers.
* Routes are defined in `routes.js` file with
  [next-routes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-routes) library. It has all the definitions and
  the mapping of the routes.

## Tests

No test for now.
