// This script was used for changing the default locale from English to German
// for the Contentful CMS by exporting the old content, fiddling with the JSON
// to change the locale, and then import the output. It's not production
// quality code, just a quick hack. But I committed it just in case.
//
// The export/import process is described here:
//
// https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/import-and-export/
//
// After exporting the file, the first step was to manually edit the locales
// section of the JSON to switch the default. Then run this script to update
// all entries and assets that only have an en locale to have a de locale
// instead. That was enough to allow an import of the data into a new Contentful
// space with German set as the default locale.
